# Welcome to OmniBox #
This is a tutoring facility fully taught by AI. We have 3 classrooms for our demo. Computer Science, History and Geography. You're able to log in with your Github/Google or create an account with us where you can login as a student. Each student has a private history of conversations with their teachers. Teachers are able to be selected by difficulty (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) and will try to only answer questions related to the field of their class.</br></br>
This is a project made in 24 hours by a team of 3 at the Montreal JAC Hackathon 2024. Hosted by John Abbott College. Majority of the code was done in the 24 hour timeline, but I added features that we couldn't finish such as the post-test review and leaderboard post hackathon. I primarily worked on the frontend while my teammates worked backend.<br />
